Game Loan Management Web Application ðŸš€ 

Iâ€™d like to share a project Iâ€™ve been working on!
This web app allows users to manage game loan records.
I built it using C#, .NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, Oracle, and Bootstrap, focusing on creating a responsive and dynamic design.
Users can create, read, update, and delete game loan records, as well as export data to Excel.

This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, with a particular focus on backend development and data management.

Technologies Used:
Backend: C# with .NET Core MVC
Frontend: HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery DataTable
Database: Entity Framework with Oracle
